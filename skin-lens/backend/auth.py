# ==========================================

# SECRET_KEY is the master password used to cryptographically sign your tokens. 
# If a hacker doesn't know this key, they cannot forge a fake token. 
# We try to load it from a .env file, but provide a weak fallback for local development.
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("JWT_SECRET_KEY", "skin-lens-dev-secret-change-me")

# ALGORITHM tells PyJWT which mathematical formula to use to scramble the token. 
# HS256 is the industry standard for standard web apps.
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

# ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES determines how long a token lives before it becomes useless.
# 1440 minutes = 24 hours. After 24 hours, the user will be forced to log in again.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = int(os.getenv("JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES", "1440"))
