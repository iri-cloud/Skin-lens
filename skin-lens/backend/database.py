# so SQLAlchemy knows exactly which Python driver to use.

    # This is crucial for serverless deployments to prevent exhausting your database's connection limits.

# autocommit=False: We must manually call db.commit() to save changes, preventing accidental half-saves.
# autoflush=False: Prevents SQLAlchemy from prematurely pushing changes to the database before we are ready.
# bind=engine: Connects these sessions to the engine we configured above.
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

# Base is the foundational Python class that all your database models (like the User table) will inherit from.
# It tells SQLAlchemy how to map your Python code to actual SQL tables.
Base = declarative_base()
